### Experienced NHS data scientist with interests in predictive modelling, machine learning, text mining, and teaching

My work focuses on modelling National Health Service (NHS) data, primarily using national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). I work primarily in `R` and SQL Server, and have experience with statistical modelling and machine learning methods. I have recently submitted my PhD thesis, on modelling methods for NHS incident reporting data, to UCL.

I advise and train hospitals, commissioners, regulators and the private sector on using data to manage hospitals, monitor quality, performance, and mortality.  I am an experienced trainer, presenter and post-grad teacher. I have built and released several `R` packages and am a keen contributor to the NHS-R Community. I lead a local `R` usergroup, and run a programme of `R` training courses for HED.
