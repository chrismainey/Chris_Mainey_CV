### Expereinced NHS data scientist with interests in predictive modelling and text mining

My work focuses on modelling National Health Service (NHS) data, primarily using the national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). I work primarily in `R` and SQL Server, and have experience with various statistical modelling and machine learning techniques. I have recently subitted my PhD thesis, focused on modelling methods for NHS incident reporting data, at UCL.

I advise and train hospitals, commissioners, regulators and the private sector on using data to manage hospitals, monitor mortality, performance, and quality.  I have a passion for using information effectively to impact peopleâ€™s health and improve their hospital care.  I am an experienced trainer, presenter and post-grad teacher. I have built and released several `R` packages, and am a keen contributor to the NHS-R Community. I lead a local `R` usergroup at UHB, and run a programme of `R` trainig courses for HED.
